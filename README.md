# 🚇 Fair Fares NYC: Expanding Access to Affordable Transportation
🏆 MHC × MTA Inaugural Datathon Project 2024

This comprehensive analysis explores Fair Fares ridership data in NYC to understand how expanding eligibility can improve access to affordable public transportation. Using advanced data analysis techniques and visualization approaches, we identify key insights to inform policy recommendations that could make public transit more equitable for all New Yorkers.

---
## 🌟 Overview
The Fair Fares NYC program provides discounted metro cards for eligible residents, currently serving those at 120% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Our analysis evaluates the potential impact of expanding eligibility to 200% FPL, with a focused examination of six key neighborhoods:
- Elmhurst/Jackson Heights  
- Flushing  
- Sunset Park  
- Brownsville  
- Morrisania  
- Highbridge  

### 💡 Research Question  
How can expanding Fair Fares eligibility criteria to 200% of the FPL improve access to affordable public transportation in underserved NYC neighborhoods? Which subway lines, bus routes, and stations should be prioritized for expansion to maximize equity and usage?
